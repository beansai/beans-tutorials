### Basic Management

Many businesses offer services that require traveling to mutilple stops every day,
and they all need an efficient way to schedule/manage the daily works.

- A stop which describes place to visit.

- A route which contains one or more stops to visit.
- An assignee (driver) who is responsible to do the delivery.
- A warehouse which may be a starting point for drivers as they will load packages on truck then star a day's delivery.
